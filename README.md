# Kidney-lesion-detection-project
Kidney stones are a common medical issue, causing severe pain and potential complications if not detected early. Traditional diagnosis methods like CT scans and ultrasounds are expensive and invasive. Project Aim: Develop a non-invasive, cost-effective kidney stone detection system using image processing and deep learning.
